    <h2>Research Questions</h2>
    <ul class="flat-list">
      <li>Is geometric rearrangement giving a reproducible control signal beyond matched-noise baselines?</li>
      <li>Which capability axes are controllable (style/format vs reasoning depth vs factual recall)?</li>
      <li>How well does the signal transfer across model families and sizes?</li>

    <h2>Continue vs Stop Gates</h2>
    <h3>Continue / invest</h3>
    <ul class="flat-list">
      <li>Each decision lane has 3 seeds x 500 tasks with matched displacement controls.</li>
      <li>Primary strict-control direction replicates in at least 3 of 5 family lanes.</li>
      <li>At least one non-one_word category separates in at least 2 families.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stop / park</h3>
    <ul class="flat-list">
      <li>Direction remains unstable across families after 5-family coverage.</li>
      <li>Observed gains are confined to one category and do not generalize under controls.</li>
      <li>No reliable target survives the pre-registered rubric in the appendix.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scratch Training Position</h2>
    <p>
      Scratch scaling is intentionally paused while post-hoc control mapping remains unresolved. The current view is that controlled transfer evidence should lead architecture-scale decisions, not the reverse.
