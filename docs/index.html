    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>Phase:</strong> Post-hoc control mapping is active. Large scratch training is paused until control effects are replicated across families with matched baselines.
    </div>
    <p>
      This public report now prioritizes high-confidence claims tied to reproducible artifacts. Older narrative sections that were not fully synchronized with run history have been trimmed.

  <section id="what-we-know">
    <h2>What We Know Now</h2>
    <ul class="flat-list">
      <li>Displacement calibration is mandatory for cross-family transfer. Fixed absolute perturbation scales do not transfer reliably.</li>
      <li>In the Devstral family, calibrated crystal variants consistently outperform displacement-matched Gaussian controls on strict-format robustness in repeated 500-task runs.</li>
      <li>A stricter semantic scorer for one-word tasks removed a known permissiveness artifact and reduced inflated semantic scores in Gaussian controls.</li>
      <li>A structured orthogonal control at matched displacement did not preserve behavior as well as calibrated crystal in the latest 4-way run.</li>
      <li>In Qwen3-4B, strict behavior direction is inverted relative to Devstral: matched controls score above base on strict format across three seeds.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="what-unknown">
    <h2>What Is Still Open</h2>
    <ul class="flat-list">
      <li>Whether the observed effects generalize across more model families and sizes.</li>
      <li>Whether geometric method effects remain superior after full control matching and seed replication in every lane.</li>
      <li>Whether the effect is mostly a format/style control, or can be made to steer deeper reasoning behavior with low capability cost.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disclosure Boundary</h2>
    <p>
      Public pages include outcomes, controls, caveats, and decision criteria. They exclude implementation details that materially increase steering precision until robustness and misuse-risk characterization are stronger.
